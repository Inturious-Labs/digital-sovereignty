&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto has grown into a $3 trillion industry with thousands of blockchains, tens of thousands of dApps, and millions of tokens. For anyone interested in this industry, it would be helpful to first understand who are the different players and stakeholders in crypto, what they do, what are their motivations, and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting a series called &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoding the Crypto Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; with 12 episodes. Each episode covers a major ecosystem player/stakeholder. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Blockchains; 2/ Miners or Nodes Operators; 3/ dApp Developers；4/ Exchanges; 5/ Market Makers; 6/ Investors; 7/ Infra Tooling; 8/ Communities; 9/ KOLs; 10/ Media; 11/ Traders; 12/ Users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to publish them in the next few weeks. If you know someone who is interested in web3/crypto, please forward this post to him/her and encourage him to subscribe to this newsletter &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz&#34;&gt;Digital Sovereign Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; where I distill complex web3 concepts into simple explanations for friends and family who are not familiar with crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is the infrastructure layer of crypto. Without blockchain, there would be no crypto. Blockchain is where all the Web3 applications reside ON. Major blockchains such as Bitcoin are similar to the big tech firms of Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Alibaba for classic web services - they carry the entire industry and dominate the airwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they play a critical role in crypto that&amp;rsquo;s even more influential than what the Magnificent Seven does for traditional industries. A unicorn startup theoretically can still exist without using any service from big tech firms, but any dApp (decentralized application) in crypto, by definition, has lineage deeply rooted in one of the major blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the crypto industry is a vast Amazon jungle. There are several extremely large and tall banyan trees that lord over all the animals and plants in the jungle even from afar. These trees continuously grow and evolve every minute, even branching out into smaller trees. They absorb the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the sun and the rainfall in the jungle. They become bigger and taller (&amp;ldquo;longer&amp;rdquo;) as time goes by. Each of these gigantic banyan trees is an ecosystem of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/decoding-the-crypto-ecosystem-ep01-blockchains/jungle-ecosystem.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jungle ecosystem&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many plants thrive under the banyan tree and even become symbiosis with it. Most of them won&amp;rsquo;t survive without the cozy shadow of the banyan or its protection from gusty winds. These smaller plants grow into bigger plants, attract bees and other animals, and further fuel the growth of the banyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These big banyans are blockchains. There are a few thousand of them in Amazon but only the top 20 matters. A blockchain without sufficient critical mass (measured by market cap and funding) does not have enough resources to attract developers to adopt its technology. The largest banyan is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed by &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. They all have tokens listed on crypto exchanges and have considerable cash reserves that could last through several bull-bear cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-blockchains-do&#34;&gt;What do blockchains do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer studios behind many large blockchains are non-profit foundations, as explained in &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/why-non-profit-in-crypto&#34;&gt;Why Non-Profit in Crypto&lt;/a&gt;. They primarily do two things, develop a blockchain and drive its adoption. A typical L1 foundation usually employs a team of 100 ~ 500 full-time employees. The majority would be in R&amp;amp;D to create new protocol features following the blockchain&amp;rsquo;s public roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most blockchains&amp;rsquo; technology is open source. Foundations engage in a variety of activities to recruit developers to build their dApps on their chains, such as publishing bounties, hosting hackathons, organizing hacker houses, conducting workshops, sponsoring industry events, giving out developer grants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of the crypto industry&amp;rsquo;s alpha, in terms of technology innovations and breakthroughs, is created at the blockchain level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockchains-vs-dapps&#34;&gt;Blockchains vs dApps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a crypto developer uses the smart contract from a blockchain or issues a token for his dApp following this blockchain&amp;rsquo;s token standard, this dApp is considered to have become part of this blockchain&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem. The dDapp may now be featured as an ecosystem showcase on the foundation&amp;rsquo;s website and its TVL (Total Value Locked) will be added to the total TVL of this blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers and blockchains need each other to survive. Each blockchain ONLY promotes startups in its ecosystem (a NIKE shop does not sell Adidas sneakers). Without the technical guidance and GTM (go-to-market) resources from the foundation, a dApp project will hardly go very far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a blockchain ecosystem without a growing developer base and buzzy developer activities is just a zombie chain. Most of the leading blockchain ecosystems claim to have dDapp projects in terms of hundreds or thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockchain-vs-blockchain&#34;&gt;Blockchain vs blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/decoding-the-crypto-ecosystem-ep01-blockchains/bulls-fighting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bulls fighting&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As blockchains try to grow their ecosystems, they compete with each other for developers to build dApps, for investors to inject liquidity, for media coverage to drive mindshare, and for users to buy their tokens. It&amp;rsquo;s quite rare for them to collaborate. Unlike traditional industries such as airlines or real estate where players can join hands to conquer a higher mountain together, in crypto your loss is my gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the large blockchains claim to have full-suite product lines, from DID/wallet, explorer/scanner, DEX, NFT marketplace, node operators, developer grants, community ambassadors, etc. They could easily fall into a deep narcissism complex and get high in their own echo chambers, at the same time displaying an astounding level of ignorance of their competitors&amp;rsquo; true capabilities. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to walk out of that bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;protocol-vs-application&#34;&gt;Protocol vs application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge for a blockchain is to figure out where to draw a line between protocol-level development and application-level development. Many people believe a blockchain should only focus on developing (open source) standards and protocols and should never veer into the application domain. The creation of dDapps should be left to the developers in the community, not the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a blockchain foundation starts developing applications, it will compete directly with its developers from the same ecosystem. The community will cry foul play and lose motivation to push the boundaries for this ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes the foundation feels it has to do this because no one from the community could step up to the plate. So this is a tricky, constantly evolving balancing act that has no simple black-and-white answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;public-vs-consortium&#34;&gt;Public vs consortium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/decoding-the-crypto-ecosystem-ep01-blockchains/noentrance.png&#34; alt=&#34;private property&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, blockchains fall into two types, public chains and consortium (or private) chains. A public chain allows anyone to access and participate in the network, while a consortium/private chain is a permissioned network where only pre-approved entities can access and validate transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consortium chains are usually not regarded as real blockchains in the daily conversation of crypto people. In certain countries with crypto restrictions such as China, consortium chains may be the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;l1-vs-l2&#34;&gt;L1 vs L2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most blockchains are just layer 1 (L1), except for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Layer 1 means the chain has just one layer and that&amp;rsquo;s where the dApps will be built on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum has a lot of scaling performance challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s too slow and too expensive, thus creating room for a plethora of layer 2 (L2) chains, which are built on top of Ethereum (L1), acting as a middle layer between the dApps and Ethereum mainnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These L2s are also called &amp;ldquo;rollups&amp;rdquo; as they process batches of transactions off-chain and then submit a single, compressed transaction to Ethereum L1, to reduce network congestion and transaction fees. Some Ethereum L2s have become quite big, even surpassing some other L1s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin now also has hundreds of L2s that try to enhance Bitcoin L1&amp;rsquo;s scalability and transaction efficiency. While ETH L1 depends on many L2s to roll up the transactions, the same relationship doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite manifest between BTC L2s and BTC L1. All these BTC L2s need to get transactions from BTC L1 to justify their reason for existence, but BTC L1 doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily rely on any particular so-called L2 to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-vs-old&#34;&gt;New vs old&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/decoding-the-crypto-ecosystem-ep01-blockchains/family-walk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;family walk of lions&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many new L1s are emerging every month. They burst into the scene with a lot of fanfare, record-breaking fund-raising urban legends, and sexy new narratives with no shortage of KOLs singing the praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s always hard to judge what is real versus just the hype in the world of L1 chains, longevity is still important in crypto. A chain that has been running for a long time tends to be much more secure and resilient to attacks. A blockchain that just released a white paper or is yet to launch its mainnet does not provide anything that can be used to verify its claims. So their claims should be reviewed with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most stupid mistake people can make is to compare a new chain not yet in production to an old chain that was already launched a few years ago. It would be prudent to wait for the new chain to run for at least 12 months AFTER launching its mainnet before making any hasty comparison and proclaiming this is the next Ethereum killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;top-20-chains&#34;&gt;Top 20 chains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://coinmarketcap.com&#34;&gt;CoinMarketCap&lt;/a&gt; is the Bloomberg for crypto. It has all the tokens listed by their market cap. As of March 05, 2025, the 20th largest blockchain is Cosmos ($ATOM) with a market cap of $1.6 billion. This list does not include stable coins (USDT/USDC), animal/meme coins (Doge, Trump), L2s (POL), dApp coins (Uniswap, DAI, BGB), non-L1 infrastructure coins (Chainlink) or blockchains that have long become dormant (Hedera, Stellar, Litecoin, Monero, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the essential ones to watch. Other blockchains are too small to matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve heard that your friend Joe just joined a crypto company. You are with him now at a dinner party, or an alumni event, or just catching up over a beer at a bar. What kind of questions could you ask Joe that would come across as interesting, non-imposing and smart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a casual level, you have a slight fleeting interest in crypto as you just read some sensational headline stories from that industry. Now you can find out more to keep this innocent party conversation going without boring either party too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a more serious level, you have a growing interest in crypto because it was the hottest talk for a few years before AI sucked up all the air in the room. You work in finance and find it mildly amusing that this crypto thing with puny market cap tries to disrupt your industry. Or you work in big tech and find it entertaining that crypto people talk about AI as if that is THEIR thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a more professional level, you are thinking of pivoting your career into crypto, too. You want to size up Joe to see if he&amp;rsquo;s a legit insider in the know, who can make some intros for you. You want to know if this crypto industry is worth investing the next few years of your life to build a new track record. You might even want to start buying some tokens and try to see if your friend knows much alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking the right question demonstrates real intelligence and the radius of one&amp;rsquo;s knowledge boundary. Here are a few questions you could throw at him/her. As someone on the other side of the table, I rarely get them, which says a lot about crypto&amp;rsquo;s strenuous long march toward mass adoption and challenges in driving mindshare in the general public. Maybe these questions are just my own wishful thinking, but let&amp;rsquo;s have a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any big event lately? Which one did you go? How was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the easy opener. Crypto is a very event-driven industry. People go there to speak, social, source leads, and catch up with friends. From the event location, the sponsors, the hosts, the crow size, to the speakers, you can get a glimpse into which direction the wind is blowing - they&amp;rsquo;re constantly changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the current sentiment among your crypto friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another softball question that almost everyone can catch. There is hardly a dull day in crypto. Either a community gets rug-pulled, or a wallet is hacked, or a country head issues a memecoin, or Vitalik is dating a new girl friend (ETH selling signal), or Bitcoin just drops another 5%, or another project out of nowhere just soars 100x, or a T1 project announces another generous air-drop to all token holders sending the market into stratosphere. Let him talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the hot topics in crypto now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto has a roller-coaster ride of rotating trending verticals every few months. From NFT, metaverse, gameFi, socialFi, DePIN, RWA, PayFi, BTCFi, BTC L2, DID, Data Availability, memecoin, stalecoin, ZK, FHE, modular chain, intent-based protocol, launchpad to now AI agent, we&amp;rsquo;re in a constant war of narratives. Many fade out quickly in just a few months. This is where you can tell if Joe just follows the crowd or he truly has some unique perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do and how is this different from your last job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in web3 is night and day different from working in a traditional industry. I&amp;rsquo;ll share in a separate post later on this topic, for the good, the bad, and the ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than Bitcoin, what other tokens do you think would be a good buy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people in crypto agree on the value of Bitcoin so the real question is not whether or not you should buy Bitcoin, but what else you could buy. Everybody has some other tokens, which is a good reflection of his work, his technical conviction, his portfolio strategy (if he has one), and his long-term belief in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen any cool applications recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few people get this far. It&amp;rsquo;s such an easy, sensible and stimulating question. I can talk for hours and introduce you to all the interesting new new things from Web3. Maybe in traditional industries (except for AI), there are simply not that many new innovations or ground-breaking products people feel worth talking about, and they have lost that curiosity all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you get news for crypto? What do you read?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be the topic for another post later on. It&amp;rsquo;s a super important question in 2025 as everyone is bombarded by all sorts of narratives in echo chamber. We need to pick information filters carefully, and avoid being enslaved by it. It&amp;rsquo;s becoming increasingly harder to get to the high-quality information source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you buy your tokens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking this question shows that you&amp;rsquo;ve finally stepped over an invisible hurdle and are thinking about crypto seriously. Before this, you are just dancing around with a curious look and no skin in the game. This will be the start of a more intellectually stimulating relationship between you and Joe. Take the dive and see what advice Joe can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the things that only crypto can do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the best question of all. It will challenge many Joes in crypto and tells you how much Joe actually understands crypto. Many great innovations in crypto are doing financial transactions in a different manner. It&amp;rsquo;s probably faster, with higher leverage and a flair of decentralization, but its contribution to the society as a whole could be still debatable with many nuances if one digs deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s best to avoid the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much do you think Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s price will go? Is it a good time to buy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe will dutifully and probably eagerly offer his grandiose view even though he actually has absolutely no idea. Nobody in the industry does and everybody wants to sound smart, especially in front of his good old Web2 friends. This question may sound like a cute hook to kick off a conversation, but it&amp;rsquo;s a meaningless discussion. Buying an asset is not a difficult decision. When to sell is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about data privacy? Why is that important?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t go into the hornet&amp;rsquo;s nest. Your friendship with Joe may not survive this question. Everybody has a different view and nobody can convince others. There is a Hamlet for everyone and everyone has his own definition of data privacy, data ownership and data sovereignty. The society at large is not ready for achieving a consensus on this topic yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, don’t sweat about which questions to ask. Crypto is fun and truly cutting edge on many fronts. You can jump off anywhere and find a beautiful gorge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Why Non-Profit Foundation in Crypto?</title>
        <link>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/why-non-profit-foundation-in-crypto/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:00:37 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/why-non-profit-foundation-in-crypto/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/why-non-profit-foundation-in-crypto/foundation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Non-Profit Foundation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When friends hear that I work in a non-profit foundation headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, they&amp;rsquo;re often surprised. This is a difficult concept to grasp, for people who are used to working for corporations, listed companies, LLCs, offshore entities, etc. Revenue and profit are supposed to be the dominant measures of success. What do you guys do in a non-profit, promoting world peace? Why using non-profit as your legal format? I was pretty confused about it too, when I first learned about this concept in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for one such non-profit foundation of a leading L1 blockchain for a few years since then. Non-profit foundation is actually the default standard for some of the most famous developer studios behind the largest blockchains in the world. The Ethereum Foundation for Ethereum, the Solana Foundation for Solana, the Cardano Foundation for Cardano, the DFINITY Foundation for ICP, the Cosmos Foundation for Cosmos, and many others, are all non-profit foundation whose mandate does not allow revenue generation, and many of them are based in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a legal reason for that. All these large blockchains have tokens that are traded on crypto exchanges, similar to the listed stocks by the big tech companies such as the Magnificent Seven. It&amp;rsquo;s imperative for them to make a case that the token is NOT a &amp;ldquo;security&amp;rdquo;, but of utility and/or governance uses. If a token is deemed a financial security, it would be under the purview and regulation of SEC in the United States, which traditionally has a very contentious relationship with crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registered in Switzerland as a non-profit foundation lends strong support to the argument that the token is not a security. A crypto foundation is no different from the Python Foundation, the Linux Foundation, or the Rust Foundation. They all exist to promote the mass adoption of a technology, which is often open source and could be considered a public good. In contrast, while a for-profit legal entity excels at selling goods and services and monetize that offering, it does not necessarily facilitate the proliferation of a cutting edge new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a crypto non-profit foundation is not permitted by law to generate revenue, how does it generate cash to support its operation? Most of these large foundations go through a typical journey of raising funding from institutional and private investors before launching the mainnet; raising public funding when the token is listed on major exchanges; and selling token on exchanges or through OTC to get cash. Doing all these would usually be sufficient to support the day-to-day operation, including staff salaries, rental, marketing expenses, for a major L1 foundation of 100 ~ 200 full-time employees. The main job for a non-profit crypto foundation is research and development for new blockchain technology and launching new features off its road map. It does not need to &amp;ldquo;scale&amp;rdquo; to tens of thousands of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the above mentioned three sources of cash, the first two are just one-off events but the third one is the on-going one and thus most important. The developer studio (that is often registered a non-profit) is usually a major holder of its token. If the token price goes up, it will generate a steady flow of cash for the foundation as the team unloads its token periodically, hopefully with increasingly smaller chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if the price will go up? Nobody knows that for sure and that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re striving for. If it&amp;rsquo;s a good technology and we market that effectively, more developers will start using this smart contract technology to build decentralized applications (&amp;ldquo;dApp&amp;rdquo;). Some of those dApps might become killer applications and draw millions of users. Increase of user interaction will consume resources, either in the form of a network toll fee (the infamous &amp;ldquo;gas&amp;rdquo; for Ethereum), or in the form of compute resources for running programs and storing data (in the case of the Internet Computer). Those network/compute resources are converted from the tokens of L1 blockchains. So more network activities will &amp;ldquo;burn off&amp;rdquo; the token and reduce its circulating supply. When there are less token available in the open market, the continuous buying pressure (because developers need to buy tokens to support the growing needs of their dApps, just like they need to pay the monthly bills to AWS/Azure/Google) tend to push up the price. In the crypto world, the long-term success of an L1 blockchain technology will in the end be reflected in its token price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if the foundation sells off ALL its token? The tokenomics of these tokens usually will lead to a scenario where the original developer studio will have less and less of this token so more of it will become available in the open market. This is an important aspect of this L1&amp;rsquo;s decentralization - the power needs to be in the hands of more people. If the day comes when the foundation has no more token to sell, it will not have enough cash to sustain its operation and will probably cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, would actually be the ultimate success of this L1 - it&amp;rsquo;s become so decentralized that the founding team is no longer needed. The technology has become so widespread, achieved so much mass adoption, and created so much demand among developers, users, node operators and investors that the flying wheel can keep spinning on its own without a dominant, central force to keep his hands on the steering wheel. Nobody needs to remember the name of the original foundation any more, only its tech when it’s become an integral way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Hari Seldon is just s myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the multitude&amp;rsquo;s roar, silence finds its sanctuary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;万人如海一身藏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

The developer studio (that is often registered a non-profit) is usually a major holder of its token. If the token price goes up, it will generate a steady flow of cash for the foundation as the team unloads its token periodically, hopefully with increasingly smaller chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if the price will go up? Nobody knows that for sure and that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re striving for. If it&amp;rsquo;s a good technology and we market that effectively, more developers will start using this smart contract technology to build decentralized applications (&amp;ldquo;dApp&amp;rdquo;). Some of those dApps might become killer applications and draw millions of users. Increase of user interaction will consume resources, either in the form of a network toll fee (the infamous &amp;ldquo;gas&amp;rdquo; for Ethereum), or in the form of compute resources for running programs and storing data (in the case of the Internet Computer). Those network/compute resources are converted from the tokens of L1 blockchains. So more network activities will &amp;ldquo;burn off&amp;rdquo; the token and reduce its circulating supply. When there are less token available in the open market, the continuous buying pressure (because developers need to buy tokens to support the growing needs of their dApps, just like they need to pay the monthly bills to AWS/Azure/Google) tend to push up the price. In the crypto world, the long-term success of an L1 blockchain technology will in the end be reflected in its token price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if the foundation sells off ALL its token? The tokenomics of these tokens usually will lead to a scenario where the original developer studio will have less and less of this token so more of it will become available in the open market. This is an important aspect of this L1&amp;rsquo;s decentralization - the power needs to be in the hands of more people. If the day comes when the foundation has no more token to sell, it will not have enough cash to sustain its operation and will probably cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, would actually be the ultimate success of this L1 - it&amp;rsquo;s become so decentralized that the founding team is no longer needed. The technology has become so widespread, achieved so much mass adoption, and created so much demand among developers, users, node operators and investors that the flying wheel can keep spinning on its own without a dominant, central force to keep his hands on the steering wheel. Nobody needs to remember the name of the original foundation any more, only its tech when it’s become an integral way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Hari Seldon is just s myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the multitude&amp;rsquo;s roar, silence finds its sanctuary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;万人如海一身藏&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Download Twitter Spaces Audio for Free</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/download-twitter-spaces-audio-for/twitter-spaces.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Twitter Spaces&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its launch to the general public in May 2021, which as-a-matter-of-factly crushed one-hit wonder Clubhouse, &lt;strong&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/strong&gt; has become a very popular tool for KOLs and communities to host panel discussions, town fall meetings, AMA (Ask-Me-Anything), or even public debates. The top spaces often draw millions of listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Twitter doesn’t allow easy download of the audio files from those spaces. Only the original host of the space can download audio file and that process is painfully slow, manual and arcane. I frequently join Twitter Spaces to moderate panel discussions or speak on all things ICP and Web3. It would be cool to have access to my own public talk records even when most of the time my Twitter account is not the host of those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried many methods over the last three years to download the audio files from Twitter Spaces. Some websites offer solutions for a fee, but I don’t want to rely on them. In the world of free DIY hacks, many methods usually worked for a while, then failed after a few months as Twitter revised its API in a constantly evolving game of cat and mouse. The current one&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote-1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; seems to be quite resilient. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-download-youtube-dl&#34;&gt;1. Download youtube-dl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the open-source, command-line tool &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html&#34;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from its official site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html&#34;&gt;https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’m on a mac, I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ brew install youtube-dl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ youtube-dl --version
2021.12.17
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-find-twitter-spaces-url&#34;&gt;2. Find Twitter Spaces URL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./2d65d514-99f7-4045-880e-b4b48bd0f351_2306x1670.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/download-twitter-spaces-audio-for/2d65d514-99f7-4045-880e-b4b48bd0f351_2306x1670.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Firefox&lt;a href=&#34;#footnote-2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; browser. Go to &lt;strong&gt;Tools/Browser Tools/&lt;/strong&gt; and open “&lt;strong&gt;Web Developer Tools&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the Twitter Spaces’ URL, for example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/i/spaces/1MnGnDkaZQYxO/peek&#34;&gt;https://x.com/i/spaces/1MnGnDkaZQYxO/peek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the developer console that opens up at the bottom of the window, go to “&lt;strong&gt;Network&lt;/strong&gt;” tab and play the Twitter Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./b5fc2c63-0d02-47c7-914b-5f49ea6db890_2310x1918.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/download-twitter-spaces-audio-for/b5fc2c63-0d02-47c7-914b-5f49ea6db890_2310x1918.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type “&lt;strong&gt;m3u&lt;/strong&gt;” in the filter field in the console. The console will filter out all other assets and display only the m3u list file. Copy its URL. It’s a very long URL and that’s normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-download-mp3-file&#34;&gt;3. Download MP3 File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Terminal window, go to the directory where you want to save the file to and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ youtube-dl “space-url”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or in this case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ youtube-dl “https://prod-fastly-ap-northeast-1.video.pscp.tv/Transcoding/v1/hls/rYPyO8vMirREg7n-5rhdt5E_nbtP4XXumHrI0DXbCNAtl0pP1DP6hew8SQXM0IMlGdvCPwQ-2fNKAIngFlvDLg/non_transcode/ap-northeast-1/periscope-replay-direct-prod-ap-northeast-1-public/audio-space/playlist_16710828688056387844.m3u8?type=replay”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./3265dc95-7006-4cb0-be77-6e9dee70b7f4_1696x974.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/download-twitter-spaces-audio-for/3265dc95-7006-4cb0-be77-6e9dee70b7f4_1696x974.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would try to download an &lt;strong&gt;mp4&lt;/strong&gt; video file. For a one-hour Spaces event, the mp4 is about 40-50 MB in size; for a three-hour event, it’s about 80-120 MB. Youtube-dl breaks up the destination file into many smaller chunks and downloads them one by one. This process is slower than a typical straight download from website and could take 10-30 minutes. It’s pretty steady though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./c3c7fd51-dbba-4eb9-a57e-0670a4d832dc_1688x284.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/download-twitter-spaces-audio-for/c3c7fd51-dbba-4eb9-a57e-0670a4d832dc_1688x284.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-convert-video-into-audio&#34;&gt;4. Convert Video into Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mp4 file is called:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;playlist_16710828688056387844-playlist_16710828688056387844.mp4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can further convert this video file into an audio one with another command-line tool, the ultra versatile Swiss knife &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ffmpeg.org&#34;&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that can handle any media file at ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ffmpeg -i &amp;#34;your-video-name.mp4&amp;#34; -vn -acodec copy your-audio-file-name.aac
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run this in Terminal,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ffmpeg -i &amp;#34;playlist_16710828688056387844-playlist_16710828688056387844.mp4&amp;#34; -vn -acodec copy your-audio-file-name.aac
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./ff920079-04b0-4ac4-b3e4-3ee541cd6904_2252x1538.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/download-twitter-spaces-audio-for/ff920079-04b0-4ac4-b3e4-3ee541cd6904_2252x1538.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will result in an &lt;strong&gt;.aac&lt;/strong&gt; audio file, which is slightly smaller than its original video container form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can save the video/audio file in your own depository and share that on social platforms such as Substack or Youtube, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 2025, you can just run this command to start the download:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ yt-dlp twitter-spaces-url
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can probably also do that on Chrome or Safari browser, if you know where to locate the network asset&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Recap of Marc Andreessen&#39;s Talk on Lex Fridman Podcast</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-marc-andreessens-talk-on/andreessen.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Andreessen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Andreessen has been on a roll lately, from Joe Rogan to Lex Fridman to Patrick O&amp;rsquo;Shaughnessy. This episode on Fridman recorded on January 27 is the longest one, clocking at 5h:16m. It talks about America’s new spirit, Wokeness, “thought criminals”, DEI, problems at universities, affirmative action, and AI. Andreessen is very bullish on America’s future. I took down some notes that I found useful and insightful. The original, full transcript can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://lexfridman.com/marc-andreessen-2-transcript&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outlook-for-america&#34;&gt;Outlook for America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time for America is the &lt;strong&gt;Roaring Twenties&lt;/strong&gt; and that will probably return in the next few years. US&amp;rsquo; economy is very resilient because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a blessed geography that provides national security and abundant resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US can be energy independent anytime it wants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has the most most dynamic and progressive people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is still the most advanced technology leader (though manufacturing is an issue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All US&amp;rsquo; competitors are struggling with profound issues. US has a very strong competitive position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 10 years is like the miserable 70s that was filled with bleak and disheartening news. &lt;strong&gt;President Regan&lt;/strong&gt; then came along and saved US. Marc&amp;rsquo;s alluded to suggesting &lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt; might do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-civilization-progress&#34;&gt;Does Civilization Progress?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French historian &lt;strong&gt;Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges&lt;/strong&gt; was a walking encyclopedia of Roman and Greek culture. He wrote a book, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ancient_City&#34;&gt;The Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in 1864.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He reconstructed the society before greeks and romans, which was Indo-Europeans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No technology and everything was about survival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social order followed, family, tribe, and city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero concept of individual rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything that was strong was good. Anything that was weak means death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum fascism combined with maximum communism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No market economy and everything was shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversational wisdom says that we get better each year and civilization always progresses ahead. Indo-European ancestors would beg to differ and say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no, you people have fallen into shit! Your civilization has been regressing, not progressing. You&amp;rsquo;re not doing better than we are!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity politics is worshipping ancestors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wokeness-in-us&#34;&gt;Wokeness in US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many parts of US, from Silicon Valley to Hollywood, felt reinvigorated after Sep 6. Some people are still anti-Trump, but there is a strong sense of optimism that suggests the miserable last ten years is behind us, Wokeness is over and many impactful projects that have been on-hold will now reboot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry Fink&lt;/strong&gt;, CEO of &lt;strong&gt;Blackrock&lt;/strong&gt; used to be the first one to embrace all the stupid ideological initiatives of the left (such as ESG). He’s been back-paddling on many of those in the last 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/strong&gt; imposed diversity requirements for the board of listed companies. So ironically &lt;strong&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/strong&gt; became a diversity hire in one of the boards he and Marc sat on. That was very offensive to Peter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a further board requirement for LGBT. The &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; part is especially hard to meet. Marc is like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this company, but not so much to go &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, is there a test for “B”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;secret-dance-of-thought-criminals&#34;&gt;Secret Dance of Thought Criminals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are conformists. At an event, you run into someone and have a chat. You feel you get along with him, share the same social-political view, and try to venture further. You crack a joke. If he doesn’t laugh, you slowly back away from the awkward moment. If he laughs, you just establish a secret handshake with another thought criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joke&lt;/strong&gt; is how you find out other thought criminals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have deniability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laughing is voluntary. You can’t fake that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you think about if you want to bring the third thought criminal new friend to a dinner party of 6-8 people. You do a lot of dancing, essentially vetting, to make sure it’s safe for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally you go to the dinner party and have the best time of your life. No more bullshit and finally you can say the real things with like-minded people. At such party, jokes are traded around and constantly testing the boundary. Sometimes a joke goes too far and someone becomes uncomfortable and people go, this is too soon, maybe we come back to this next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the current America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-truth-and-public-life&#34;&gt;Private Truth and Public Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Substack&lt;/strong&gt; are two great tools to ensure freedom of speech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message disappearing feature on &lt;strong&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Signal&lt;/strong&gt; are also instrumental&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Truth and Public Life&lt;/strong&gt; is the best book on this subject&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consequence of public lying is that you no longer have a gauge how many people agree with you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If only 10% agree with you, you get killed; if 90% agree with you, you win the revolution. So this percentage is really important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happened in the last 2 years came straight out of this book - &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; stood up and caught their bullshit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other great books, &lt;strong&gt;The Power of Powerless&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The True Believers&lt;/strong&gt;, which talks about how elites align their beliefs with the mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc thinks &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; is 100% consistent between what he says publicly and privately. The other two guys are &lt;strong&gt;Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc&amp;rsquo;s view on the distribution of social beliefs in US:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% are true believers (Ford Foundation, Washington Post, New York Times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% are the mass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% are counter-elite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the last ten years the middle 60% went with woke. Now they’re pivoting in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a civil war now within the Democratic Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One side is saying we should be less radical and go back to the middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other side is saying we’re weak and not standing up to our principles. We need to go even more hard-core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc beat on this &lt;strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/strong&gt; professor, a friend of Fridman, who dared not come on to the his podcast because its past guest list already includes Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His tenure at Harvard is supposed to provide him with academic freedom and privilege of saying whatever he wants but that is gone. The system is completely rotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current university is a cartel system and is fundamentally broke. The only way to progress is wait for some of these universities to go bankrupt, just like corporations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture change cannot succeed from within (for example, GE). The only way to engineer change is to start something new that replaces the old one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unchecked-power-of-media--government&#34;&gt;Unchecked Power of Media &amp;amp; Government&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically it’s impossible to start an internet business with zero censorship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Party turned &lt;strong&gt;hate speech&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;misinformation&lt;/strong&gt; into weapons of mass censorship (Twitter leaked files and another similar case with Meta)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things happened that broke through this censorship blockade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack&lt;/strong&gt; was carrying the flag for free speech despite of being under intense pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s buying and revamping of &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Steward&lt;/strong&gt; spoke out courageously on the truth of &lt;strong&gt;Covid&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/strong&gt; show. That was the first time somebody blew this up on mainstream media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common experience of every past and present &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; CEO is daily beatings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO is a very lonely job. He can’t talk to anyone about his issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible for a company to fight with the government&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government decided that the first amendment didn&amp;rsquo;t apply to them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Internet Observatory&lt;/strong&gt; is outright illegal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does government exert power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legislation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third one, administration power, is often most powerful and hurtful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s crypto project &lt;strong&gt;Libra&lt;/strong&gt; was torpedoed by a threat letter from two senators to all the banks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was neither a legislation nor a regulation, but enough to scare away all the potential customers of Libra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censorship machine is like the ring of power from &lt;strong&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s infinitely tempting and will corrupt anyone, like it does for Gulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money doesn’t necessarily win political battles. Hilary outspent Trump 3:1 in 2016 and still lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many institutions attempted to experiment different types of democracy. &lt;strong&gt;California&lt;/strong&gt;’s proposition system is one example but is a complete failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A columnist of &lt;strong&gt;NYT&lt;/strong&gt; can get a CEO fired, but not the other way around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question &lt;strong&gt;Machiavelli&lt;/strong&gt; would ask: who has the ultimate power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc mentioned the the intriguing turmoil of &lt;strong&gt;LA Times&lt;/strong&gt;, where its reporters seemed to be more powerful than its owner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both praised &lt;strong&gt;Bill Ackman&lt;/strong&gt; for his crusade on the establishment education institutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He’s using skills from activism PE play (exert control of the company and effect changes with only minority stake) in a new area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new administration staff is a gigantic upgrade to the previous regime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pound for pound the best since Eisenhower, such as new head of &lt;strong&gt;NIH&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;FDA&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CDC&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this effort of unwinding government regulation and spending different from previous attempts by Gore and Regan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US is adding $1 trillion debt every 100 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The level of contempt for taxpayers is off the chart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;immigration-affirmative-action--dei&#34;&gt;Immigration, Affirmative Action &amp;amp; DEI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc used to be a strong supporter for &lt;strong&gt;H1B&lt;/strong&gt;, but there are nuances to this issue than meets the eye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no flow of talent from small town (like the one where Marc grew up in Wisconsin) in America to Silicon Valley or big cities. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirmative Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented 2023 case of &lt;strong&gt;Harvard vs UNC&lt;/strong&gt; that revealed the inner workings of Harvard admission office and how &lt;strong&gt;racist&lt;/strong&gt; it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asians need to score 400 points higher on SAT to get admitted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A running joke in Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s medical community - if you want to hire a super genius, hire an Asian student from Harvard because he’s guaranteed to be an Einstein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asians and Jews have been systematically excluded from the establishment system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvard was struggling to recruit American-born black students, so they recruited blacks from Nigeria or Northern African countries (where &lt;strong&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/strong&gt; came from), which accounted for 50% of the blacks admitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This totally defeats the purpose of affirmative action, which is supposed to compensate for the injustice to the slave ancestors of the current black population in America. Blacks imported from other countries are NOT entitled to affirmative action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the DEI programs bear the same characteristics in this 2023 Harvard case. This prevalent practice has been going on for decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H1B issue needs to be reviewed together with DEI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;americas-education-system&#34;&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Education System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest evil thing the Western civilization has done is &lt;strong&gt;colonization&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;resource extraction&lt;/strong&gt; (Avatar 2009), but somehow the west is at peace with brain-drain of human capital from other countries. Marc is contemplating whether this is justified or just the same evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if US is getting stronger and other countries are faltering? US needs other countries to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley no longer relies on H1B visa, but &lt;strong&gt;O-1 visa&lt;/strong&gt; - the super genius visa, to recruit real talents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For companies like Amazon that has unlimited resources, they can launch long term program to groom American-born talents, but they still choose to hire foreign talents via H1B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to flame the issue or diffuse the issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diffuse the issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Merit Scholarship looks for 0.5% brightest kids in the country but not a single university is using that to scout for talents, and they all have full-time scout teams for basketball players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAT is an IQ test but it has been dumb-ed down in the last ten years and become more coachable, which benefits Asian families&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are too many kids that can score 800 now. 800 is no longer an accurate indicator for intelligence. It doesn’t identify genius any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next-for-ai&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next for AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies fall into two forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak form: adding AI as the 6th bullet point on top of what it already does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong form: using AI to redo everything (Cursor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new breed of companies would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have redesigned org chart powered by AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human manages a fleet of AI agents, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI manages human (AI is actually better at process-driven management)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be entirely run by AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many large companies are unable to innovate NOT because they’re badly run, but because they’re very well run in serving their existing customers. That’s why there are always opportunities for startups who come from nowhere with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several trillion-dollar questions for AI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large models vs small models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open models vs close models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to use synthetic data or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far can you push Chain-of-Thought and Reinforcement-Learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 battles that are waged by government&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media censorship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debanking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War on crypto industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4th battle may happen to AI where political regime tries to restrict AI tech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack&lt;/strong&gt; has become home to many high-quality thoughtful contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto provides the ideal economy for a future world filled with AI agents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three “Godfathers of AI”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yann LeCun is a strong critic for LLMs and thinks it’s an evolution dead-end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton are extreme radicals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s good to have LeCun to counter the other two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s Marc’s definition of success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making contribution to the society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fun-bits&#34;&gt;Fun Bits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marc’s 9-year old son watches South Park and plays coding challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2008 film &lt;strong&gt;Tropic Thunder&lt;/strong&gt; is legendary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-marc-andreessens-talk-on/andreessen.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Andreessen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Andreessen has been on a roll lately, from Joe Rogan to Lex Fridman to Patrick O&amp;rsquo;Shaughnessy. This episode on Fridman recorded on January 27 is the longest one, clocking at 5h:16m. It talks about America’s new spirit, Wokeness, “thought criminals”, DEI, problems at universities, affirmative action, and AI. Andreessen is very bullish on America’s future. I took down some notes that I found useful and insightful. The original, full transcript can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://lexfridman.com/marc-andreessen-2-transcript&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outlook-for-america&#34;&gt;Outlook for America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time for America is the &lt;strong&gt;Roaring Twenties&lt;/strong&gt; and that will probably return in the next few years. US&amp;rsquo; economy is very resilient because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a blessed geography that provides national security and abundant resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US can be energy independent anytime it wants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has the most most dynamic and progressive people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is still the most advanced technology leader (though manufacturing is an issue)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All US&amp;rsquo; competitors are struggling with profound issues. US has a very strong competitive position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 10 years is like the miserable 70s that was filled with bleak and disheartening news. &lt;strong&gt;President Regan&lt;/strong&gt; then came along and saved US. Marc&amp;rsquo;s alluded to suggesting &lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt; might do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-civilization-progress&#34;&gt;Does Civilization Progress?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French historian &lt;strong&gt;Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges&lt;/strong&gt; was a walking encyclopedia of Roman and Greek culture. He wrote a book, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ancient_City&#34;&gt;The Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, in 1864.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He reconstructed the society before greeks and romans, which was Indo-Europeans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No technology and everything was about survival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social order followed, family, tribe, and city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero concept of individual rights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything that was strong was good. Anything that was weak means death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum fascism combined with maximum communism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No market economy and everything was shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversational wisdom says that we get better each year and civilization always progresses ahead. Indo-European ancestors would beg to differ and say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no, you people have fallen into shit! Your civilization has been regressing, not progressing. You&amp;rsquo;re not doing better than we are!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity politics is worshipping ancestors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wokeness-in-us&#34;&gt;Wokeness in US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many parts of US, from Silicon Valley to Hollywood, felt reinvigorated after Sep 6. Some people are still anti-Trump, but there is a strong sense of optimism that suggests the miserable last ten years is behind us, Wokeness is over and many impactful projects that have been on-hold will now reboot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry Fink&lt;/strong&gt;, CEO of &lt;strong&gt;Blackrock&lt;/strong&gt; used to be the first one to embrace all the stupid ideological initiatives of the left (such as ESG). He’s been back-paddling on many of those in the last 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/strong&gt; imposed diversity requirements for the board of listed companies. So ironically &lt;strong&gt;Peter Thiel&lt;/strong&gt; became a diversity hire in one of the boards he and Marc sat on. That was very offensive to Peter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a further board requirement for LGBT. The &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; part is especially hard to meet. Marc is like:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this company, but not so much to go &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, is there a test for “B”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;secret-dance-of-thought-criminals&#34;&gt;Secret Dance of Thought Criminals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are conformists. At an event, you run into someone and have a chat. You feel you get along with him, share the same social-political view, and try to venture further. You crack a joke. If he doesn’t laugh, you slowly back away from the awkward moment. If he laughs, you just establish a secret handshake with another thought criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joke&lt;/strong&gt; is how you find out other thought criminals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have deniability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laughing is voluntary. You can’t fake that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you think about if you want to bring the third thought criminal new friend to a dinner party of 6-8 people. You do a lot of dancing, essentially vetting, to make sure it’s safe for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally you go to the dinner party and have the best time of your life. No more bullshit and finally you can say the real things with like-minded people. At such party, jokes are traded around and constantly testing the boundary. Sometimes a joke goes too far and someone becomes uncomfortable and people go, this is too soon, maybe we come back to this next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the current America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-truth-and-public-life&#34;&gt;Private Truth and Public Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Substack&lt;/strong&gt; are two great tools to ensure freedom of speech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message disappearing feature on &lt;strong&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Signal&lt;/strong&gt; are also instrumental&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Truth and Public Life&lt;/strong&gt; is the best book on this subject&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consequence of public lying is that you no longer have a gauge how many people agree with you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If only 10% agree with you, you get killed; if 90% agree with you, you win the revolution. So this percentage is really important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happened in the last 2 years came straight out of this book - &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; stood up and caught their bullshit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other great books, &lt;strong&gt;The Power of Powerless&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The True Believers&lt;/strong&gt;, which talks about how elites align their beliefs with the mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc thinks &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; is 100% consistent between what he says publicly and privately. The other two guys are &lt;strong&gt;Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc&amp;rsquo;s view on the distribution of social beliefs in US:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% are true believers (Ford Foundation, Washington Post, New York Times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60% are the mass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% are counter-elite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the last ten years the middle 60% went with woke. Now they’re pivoting in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a civil war now within the Democratic Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One side is saying we should be less radical and go back to the middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other side is saying we’re weak and not standing up to our principles. We need to go even more hard-core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc beat on this &lt;strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/strong&gt; professor, a friend of Fridman, who dared not come on to the his podcast because its past guest list already includes Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His tenure at Harvard is supposed to provide him with academic freedom and privilege of saying whatever he wants but that is gone. The system is completely rotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current university is a cartel system and is fundamentally broke. The only way to progress is wait for some of these universities to go bankrupt, just like corporations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture change cannot succeed from within (for example, GE). The only way to engineer change is to start something new that replaces the old one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unchecked-power-of-media--government&#34;&gt;Unchecked Power of Media &amp;amp; Government&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically it’s impossible to start an internet business with zero censorship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Party turned &lt;strong&gt;hate speech&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;misinformation&lt;/strong&gt; into weapons of mass censorship (Twitter leaked files and another similar case with Meta)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things happened that broke through this censorship blockade:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack&lt;/strong&gt; was carrying the flag for free speech despite of being under intense pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s buying and revamping of &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon Steward&lt;/strong&gt; spoke out courageously on the truth of &lt;strong&gt;Covid&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/strong&gt; show. That was the first time somebody blew this up on mainstream media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common experience of every past and present &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; CEO is daily beatings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO is a very lonely job. He can’t talk to anyone about his issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible for a company to fight with the government&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government decided that the first amendment didn&amp;rsquo;t apply to them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Internet Observatory&lt;/strong&gt; is outright illegal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does government exert power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legislation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third one, administration power, is often most powerful and hurtful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s crypto project &lt;strong&gt;Libra&lt;/strong&gt; was torpedoed by a threat letter from two senators to all the banks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was neither a legislation nor a regulation, but enough to scare away all the potential customers of Libra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censorship machine is like the ring of power from &lt;strong&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s infinitely tempting and will corrupt anyone, like it does for Gulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money doesn’t necessarily win political battles. Hilary outspent Trump 3:1 in 2016 and still lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many institutions attempted to experiment different types of democracy. &lt;strong&gt;California&lt;/strong&gt;’s proposition system is one example but is a complete failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A columnist of &lt;strong&gt;NYT&lt;/strong&gt; can get a CEO fired, but not the other way around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question &lt;strong&gt;Machiavelli&lt;/strong&gt; would ask: who has the ultimate power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc mentioned the the intriguing turmoil of &lt;strong&gt;LA Times&lt;/strong&gt;, where its reporters seemed to be more powerful than its owner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both praised &lt;strong&gt;Bill Ackman&lt;/strong&gt; for his crusade on the establishment education institutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He’s using skills from activism PE play (exert control of the company and effect changes with only minority stake) in a new area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new administration staff is a gigantic upgrade to the previous regime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pound for pound the best since Eisenhower, such as new head of &lt;strong&gt;NIH&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;FDA&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CDC&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this effort of unwinding government regulation and spending different from previous attempts by Gore and Regan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US is adding $1 trillion debt every 100 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The level of contempt for taxpayers is off the chart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;immigration-affirmative-action--dei&#34;&gt;Immigration, Affirmative Action &amp;amp; DEI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc used to be a strong supporter for &lt;strong&gt;H1B&lt;/strong&gt;, but there are nuances to this issue than meets the eye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no flow of talent from small town (like the one where Marc grew up in Wisconsin) in America to Silicon Valley or big cities. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirmative Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented 2023 case of &lt;strong&gt;Harvard vs UNC&lt;/strong&gt; that revealed the inner workings of Harvard admission office and how &lt;strong&gt;racist&lt;/strong&gt; it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asians need to score 400 points higher on SAT to get admitted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A running joke in Silicon Valley&amp;rsquo;s medical community - if you want to hire a super genius, hire an Asian student from Harvard because he’s guaranteed to be an Einstein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asians and Jews have been systematically excluded from the establishment system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvard was struggling to recruit American-born black students, so they recruited blacks from Nigeria or Northern African countries (where &lt;strong&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/strong&gt; came from), which accounted for 50% of the blacks admitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This totally defeats the purpose of affirmative action, which is supposed to compensate for the injustice to the slave ancestors of the current black population in America. Blacks imported from other countries are NOT entitled to affirmative action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the DEI programs bear the same characteristics in this 2023 Harvard case. This prevalent practice has been going on for decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H1B issue needs to be reviewed together with DEI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;americas-education-system&#34;&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Education System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest evil thing the Western civilization has done is &lt;strong&gt;colonization&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;resource extraction&lt;/strong&gt; (Avatar 2009), but somehow the west is at peace with brain-drain of human capital from other countries. Marc is contemplating whether this is justified or just the same evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if US is getting stronger and other countries are faltering? US needs other countries to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley no longer relies on H1B visa, but &lt;strong&gt;O-1 visa&lt;/strong&gt; - the super genius visa, to recruit real talents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For companies like Amazon that has unlimited resources, they can launch long term program to groom American-born talents, but they still choose to hire foreign talents via H1B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to flame the issue or diffuse the issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diffuse the issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Merit Scholarship looks for 0.5% brightest kids in the country but not a single university is using that to scout for talents, and they all have full-time scout teams for basketball players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAT is an IQ test but it has been dumb-ed down in the last ten years and become more coachable, which benefits Asian families&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are too many kids that can score 800 now. 800 is no longer an accurate indicator for intelligence. It doesn’t identify genius any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next-for-ai&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next for AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies fall into two forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak form: adding AI as the 6th bullet point on top of what it already does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong form: using AI to redo everything (Cursor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new breed of companies would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have redesigned org chart powered by AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human manages a fleet of AI agents, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI manages human (AI is actually better at process-driven management)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be entirely run by AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many large companies are unable to innovate NOT because they’re badly run, but because they’re very well run in serving their existing customers. That’s why there are always opportunities for startups who come from nowhere with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several trillion-dollar questions for AI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large models vs small models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open models vs close models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to use synthetic data or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far can you push Chain-of-Thought and Reinforcement-Learning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 battles that are waged by government&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media censorship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debanking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;War on crypto industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4th battle may happen to AI where political regime tries to restrict AI tech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack&lt;/strong&gt; has become home to many high-quality thoughtful contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto provides the ideal economy for a future world filled with AI agents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three “Godfathers of AI”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yann LeCun is a strong critic for LLMs and thinks it’s an evolution dead-end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton are extreme radicals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s good to have LeCun to counter the other two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s Marc’s definition of success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Hide a Channel from Youtube Feed</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/hide-a-channel-from-youtube-feed/youtube.webp&#34; alt=&#34;youtube&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the AI age brings about an unpleasant side effect (among many others), that is, fake movie trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my guilty pleasures is to watch trailers of upcoming movies. In the past this was easy, IMDB had everything. For a while apple.com used to host high-quality trailers for major films. Eventually they’re all on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is now a proliferation of fake movies trailers on Youtube thanks to AI technology that enables anyone to create a concept art in the style of Wes Anderson easily. The increasing presence of these fake movie trailers on my Youtube feed significantly spoils the fun for me. I need to block those channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is harder than I think. On my Safari window, I go to one such channel and click the three dot “more”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/hide-a-channel-from-youtube-feed/./54c7bc92-067d-41e2-be43-a06f7cd8c28c_983x642.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pop-up window, there is only “Share channel” or “Report user” option. There is NO option for me to block this channel/user. On Reddit, people say clicking the three dot thing would lead to an option to block the channel, but I don’t see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/hide-a-channel-from-youtube-feed/./0ef255f3-775d-45b1-a6a9-2d255ef2bae1_929x852.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of tinkering, I found the solution - use the phone. In the Youtube app on my iPhone, find the foul-playing channel and click the three dot menu on the top-right corner. A pop-up menu from the bottom displays an option to block this user from my channel. There you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/hide-a-channel-from-youtube-feed/./78794d03-fb9a-4442-9963-7cd345b20dde_1320x2868.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on “Hide user from my channel” and confirm on the next window&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youtube, you deserve a medal for hiding this feature so well in such an unsuspicious corner. You really go out of your way to ensure you can bombard my feed however you want.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Recap of Lex Fridman&#39;s Podcast on DeepSeek and AI</title>
        <link>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-lex-fridmans-podcast-on/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 23:01:08 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-lex-fridmans-podcast-on/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-lex-fridmans-podcast-on/deepseek.webp&#34; alt=&#34;deepseek&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 5-hour interview must be the longest podcast episode I’ve listened to, but it’s still worth it. Below are my notes. They’re not meant to be a verbatim summary to capture every word they uttered. I only took what I found useful. You can find the full transcript &lt;a href=&#34;https://lexfridman.com/deepseek-dylan-patel-nathan-lambert-transcript&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: the first 13:15 are all ads! Fridman must be paid quite well to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deepseek--llm-battle&#34;&gt;DeepSeek &amp;amp; LLM Battle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source vs Open Weights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source requires full transparency, including training data, code and parameters, such as&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Weights focuses narrowly on releasing model parameters, not necessarily extending to training methodologies or datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DeepSeek R1 is both open weights and open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta’s Llama is only open weights in practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama 3’s technical paper is less actionable than DeepSeek’s R1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s MIT license is a lot more permissive (the most friendly license of all) than Llama’s quirky license (which unilaterally imposes many restrictions that actually go against the spirit of open source)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open weights allows users to deploy LLM locally without relying on server-based APIs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why DeepSeek can do this training at such low cost ($5M-ish)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MoE (Mixture of Experts) and MLA (Multihead Latent Attention)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama is a dense model (based on transformer architecture). All the parameters are activated and used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoE only uses some relevant parameters when solving a question, similar to the human brain. The model will learn how to route through different expert nodes for each task, thus creating more space to store parameters. Only 37 billion parameters need to be computed each time for DeepSeek R1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek uses PTX, a low-level language to schedule communication directly with chips, circumventing Nvidia’s CUDA library&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s CUDA is a standard general model that works with any LLM, but sacrificing performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s ratio of MoE is 32 experts - extremely high. Such high sparsity requires very efficient orchestration of the neuron network to avoid overloading a single expert with all the tokens while the other 31 sitting idly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitter lesson learned from DeepSeek R1’s runaway success over other LLMs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting all the human barriers out of way and let machine learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Labs are like the chip makers or drug makers. Training LLM involves many failed runs, costing huge time and money, until an optimal one is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why it’s natural for a quant fund to go into AI research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need NLP (Natural Language Processing) to understand a press release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridman must be dying to invite Liang Wenfeng to his podcast, as he just hired a Chinese translator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek only publicly claimed to use 2K GPUs to do pre-training for V3, and shared no cost data for other research efforts or shared cost with the parent hedge fund. SemiAnalysis estimates DeepSeek has close to 50K GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;export-control--race-on-ai-chips&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export Control &amp;amp; Race on AI Chips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export control won’t work well for China. There are always ways to circumvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridman, Lambert and Dylan are thinking 2030 to be the arrival moment of AGI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s Stargate project of building data centers, once completed, provides 2 Gigawatt power. This is rather ordinary and nothing special compared to what China’s superior industrial capability can build, if there is no supply constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, how to cause the most economic damage to the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitting the R&amp;amp;D centers of TSMC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some goals (80% made in China) in &lt;em&gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/em&gt; have been achieved but not the semi-conductor industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More choppy waters ahead in a dual-hegemony world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three most important aspects of an AI chip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chip-to-chip interconnection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Floating point operations (flops)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory bandwidth (I/O）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H20 (shipped 1M to China last year) looks like a castrated version of H100 (not allowed to be exported to China), but it is actually better in certain tasks, which is reasoning. It cuts down flops, but it’s on par on interconnection and even better on memory bandwidth vs H100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pre-training is all about flops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, US government only cares about flops in its export control, though the other two axises are just equally important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output tokens are more expensive than input tokens, because input tokens can be processed in batches but output tokens can’t. Output tokens compute is a non-parallel operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory is becoming super important. Reasoning and AI agents in the last few months led to much higher need for memory. Output sequence has to reside in the memory, which means fewer users can be served at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the mid-to-large companies are racing to serve DeepSeek APIs, but their throughputs in real tests are all very low&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s attention (MLA) is a different kind of attention from the attention from the &lt;em&gt;All You Need Is Attention&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI makes a very fat margin on inference but that’s not enough to recoup their costs on training&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is going to be the mainstream. DeepSeek has leveled the play field and set a high standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British English is dead because LLMs are all trained in American English (by a few tech companies in San Francisco).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superhuman persuasion will happen before superhuman intelligence - Sam Altman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I’m using the internet, the more I feel others are controlling my mind - Lex Fridman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to get the right alignment in LLM, to preserve facts as they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s extremely hard to get it right. If an LLM takes a wrong input in pre-training, it would take a huge effort to scrub it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System prompt can overwrite user prompt in the back scene. Google’s Gemini made an execution error to introduce diversity prompt in its infamous &lt;em&gt;Black Nazi&lt;/em&gt; fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two learning methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imitation learning (pre-training, supervise training, fine tuning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trial and error (reinforcement learning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 is a lot more powerful than 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the magic comes from 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore is about 20% of Nvidia’s revenue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion rule imposed by the US government will have a real impact on Chinese AI companies. Even though its LLM is good, DeepSeek doesn’t have enough GPUs to serve them to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit is still very influential as its subreddits are being scraped by all the LLMs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many AI startups train on OpenAI’s data to bootstrap themselves in the beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is a good place to do AI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Gigawatt of curtailed nuclear power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a law that allows training data from the internet with no limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diffusion rule has no restriction in Japan. Japan can do whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-centers--stargate&#34;&gt;Data Centers &amp;amp; Stargate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15-20 Megawatt is a typical size for data center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For optimal long-term planning, nuclear power plant, which has the highest energy efficiency ratio, should be right next to a data center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the short term, it’s easier to build data center next to hydropower station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gigawatt data plant is a thing now. All the T1 tech giants are racing hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI training needs GPUs to be collated in one single cluster (data center) for optimum speed (instead of routing through remote sites). That’s why these data centers are getting bigger and bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No strong competitor to Nvidia now. AMD has good hardware but its software is bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any business that is based on GPT-3 or 4 is dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware is the only place to make money now on AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrappers like Perplexity can also make money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Softbank doesn’t have that much money right now (Musk is right). Sun has to sell off Softbank’s stake in ARM first to release more cash for investing in OpenAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can’t explain Stargate’s $500 Billion number. $100 Billion is reasonable and can be justified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US government doesn’t put money into the $500 Billion deal. Its role is to allow this deal to happen (without the anti-trust hammer).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama 3’s technical paper is less actionable than DeepSeek’s R1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s MIT license is a lot more permissive (the most friendly license of all) than Llama’s quirky license (which unilaterally imposes many restrictions that actually go against the spirit of open source)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open weights allows users to deploy LLM locally without relying on server-based APIs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why DeepSeek can do this training at such low cost ($5M-ish)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MoE (Mixture of Experts) and MLA (Multihead Latent Attention)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama is a dense model (based on transformer architecture). All the parameters are activated and used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoE only uses some relevant parameters when solving a question, similar to the human brain. The model will learn how to route through different expert nodes for each task, thus creating more space to store parameters. Only 37 billion parameters need to be computed each time for DeepSeek R1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek uses PTX, a low-level language to schedule communication directly with chips, circumventing Nvidia’s CUDA library&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s CUDA is a standard general model that works with any LLM, but sacrificing performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s ratio of MoE is 32 experts - extremely high. Such high sparsity requires very efficient orchestration of the neuron network to avoid overloading a single expert with all the tokens while the other 31 sitting idly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitter lesson learned from DeepSeek R1’s runaway success over other LLMs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting all the human barriers out of way and let machine learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Labs are like the chip makers or drug makers. Training LLM involves many failed runs, costing huge time and money, until an optimal one is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why it’s natural for a quant fund to go into AI research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need NLP (Natural Language Processing) to understand a press release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridman must be dying to invite Liang Wenfeng to his podcast, as he just hired a Chinese translator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek only publicly claimed to use 2K GPUs to do pre-training for V3, and shared no cost data for other research efforts or shared cost with the parent hedge fund. SemiAnalysis estimates DeepSeek has close to 50K GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;export-control--race-on-ai-chips&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export Control &amp;amp; Race on AI Chips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export control won’t work well for China. There are always ways to circumvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridman, Lambert and Dylan are thinking 2030 to be the arrival moment of AGI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s Stargate project of building data centers, once completed, provides 2 Gigawatt power. This is rather ordinary and nothing special compared to what China’s superior industrial capability can build, if there is no supply constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, how to cause the most economic damage to the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hitting the R&amp;amp;D centers of TSMC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some goals (80% made in China) in &lt;em&gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/em&gt; have been achieved but not the semi-conductor industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More choppy waters ahead in a dual-hegemony world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three most important aspects of an AI chip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chip-to-chip interconnection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Floating point operations (flops)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory bandwidth (I/O）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H20 (shipped 1M to China last year) looks like a castrated version of H100 (not allowed to be exported to China), but it is actually better in certain tasks, which is reasoning. It cuts down flops, but it’s on par on interconnection and even better on memory bandwidth vs H100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pre-training is all about flops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, US government only cares about flops in its export control, though the other two axises are just equally important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output tokens are more expensive than input tokens, because input tokens can be processed in batches but output tokens can’t. Output tokens compute is a non-parallel operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory is becoming super important. Reasoning and AI agents in the last few months led to much higher need for memory. Output sequence has to reside in the memory, which means fewer users can be served at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the mid-to-large companies are racing to serve DeepSeek APIs, but their throughputs in real tests are all very low&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s attention (MLA) is a different kind of attention from the attention from the &lt;em&gt;All You Need Is Attention&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI makes a very fat margin on inference but that’s not enough to recoup their costs on training&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is going to be the mainstream. DeepSeek has leveled the play field and set a high standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British English is dead because LLMs are all trained in American English (by a few tech companies in San Francisco).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superhuman persuasion will happen before superhuman intelligence - Sam Altman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I’m using the internet, the more I feel others are controlling my mind - Lex Fridman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to get the right alignment in LLM, to preserve facts as they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s extremely hard to get it right. If an LLM takes a wrong input in pre-training, it would take a huge effort to scrub it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System prompt can overwrite user prompt in the back scene. Google’s Gemini made an execution error to introduce diversity prompt in its infamous &lt;em&gt;Black Nazi&lt;/em&gt; fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two learning methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imitation learning (pre-training, supervise training, fine tuning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trial and error (reinforcement learning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 is a lot more powerful than 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the magic comes from 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore is about 20% of Nvidia’s revenue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusion rule imposed by the US government will have a real impact on Chinese AI companies. Even though its LLM is good, DeepSeek doesn’t have enough GPUs to serve them to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit is still very influential as its subreddits are being scraped by all the LLMs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many AI startups train on OpenAI’s data to bootstrap themselves in the beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is a good place to do AI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 Gigawatt of curtailed nuclear power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a law that allows training data from the internet with no limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diffusion rule has no restriction in Japan. Japan can do whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-centers--stargate&#34;&gt;Data Centers &amp;amp; Stargate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15-20 Megawatt is a typical size for data center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For optimal long-term planning, nuclear power plant, which has the highest energy efficiency ratio, should be right next to a data center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the short term, it’s easier to build data center next to hydropower station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gigawatt data plant is a thing now. All the T1 tech giants are racing hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI training needs GPUs to be collated in one single cluster (data center) for optimum speed (instead of routing through remote sites). That’s why these data centers are getting bigger and bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No strong competitor to Nvidia now. AMD has good hardware but its software is bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any business that is based on GPT-3 or 4 is dead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware is the only place to make money now on AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrappers like Perplexity can also make money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Softbank doesn’t have that much money right now (Musk is right). Sun has to sell off Softbank’s stake in ARM first to release more cash for investing in OpenAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can’t explain Stargate’s $500 Billion number. $100 Billion is reasonable and can be justified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US government doesn’t put money into the $500 Billion deal. Its role is to allow this deal to happen (without the anti-trust hammer).&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>10 Podcasts on Tech in 2025</title>
        <link>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:01:30 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast has become one of my primary sources of information intake, besides Twitter, since more than ten years ago when I lived in Palo Alto, CA. In 2025, podcast is still a very potent channel for information, insight and perspectives of very high density, though its supremacy is being challenged by the rising AI LLMs that can summarize podcast episodes based on transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/podcast.webp&#34; alt=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are getting very long - such as the recent DeepSeek episode on &lt;strong&gt;Lex Fridman&lt;/strong&gt; that clocked at 5 hours 16 minutes, but still, the good ones are worth listening to. These are the top ones from my library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-lex-fridman-podcast&#34;&gt;1. Lex Fridman Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lexfridman.com/podcast&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/1d80e96f-b60d-499f-a44d-ea2ca61e5871_1280x720.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably the best tech-focused podcast right now, surpassing Tim Ferriss. Fridman books the most sought-after guests in the technology industry and has interviewed every superstar scientist and entrepreneur in AI in the last 12 months. Elon Musk is a frequent guest and his chemistry with Fridman produced many famous moments. Fridman is a research scientist at MIT with strong tech background, so he’s able to ask very penetrating questions that get to the core of the topics. Occasionally he gets carried away (like the episode with Neal Stephenson of Snow Crash) by talking too much of himself, but most of the time he is a graceful and skillful host. One complaint: his ad now takes up almost 8-10 minutes upfront in each episode. It’s just audacious but does demonstrate what a strong brand his show has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-acquired&#34;&gt;2. Acquired&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acquired.fm&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/f80c5c6a-a0e4-45af-9714-09859449432d_2054x970.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal do a superb job of researching and dissecting the growth stories of successful companies, from TSMC, NVIDIA, Lockheed Martin, to Duolingo. Their episodes are long - usually 3 hours and above, but extremely insightful, easily trumping any business case write-ups from Stanford/Harvard. Sometimes they interview the founders (Morris Chang of TSMC or Zuckerberg of Meta); sometimes they just walk through the history of a company and break down its less well known success formula (like Lockheed Martin). All their episodes are of very high quality and always intellectually stimulating. It’s a gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-techmeme-ride-home&#34;&gt;3. Techmeme Ride Home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/dcad842f-c071-497c-a5ae-f285b9ea511e_1280x720.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very hard to do a daily podcast show but Techmeme Ride home pulls it off very well. If you need your daily fix of catching up with what’s going on in either traditional tech or Web3, this is the one and only show for you. Other similar shows are either exclusive on Web3/crypto, or are only covering Web2, which are still important but less exciting. Each episode is only 20 minutes - this is PERFECT. Anything longer than that will just create fatigue and not be able to keep its subscribers engaged on a daily basis. I’m a fan of host Brian McCullough’s rapid-fire style. It’s very energetic, just like a grande hazelnut latte in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-colin-wus-crypto-podcast-吴说不加密播客&#34;&gt;4. Colin Wu’s Crypto Podcast (吴说不加密播客)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/show/0p30Adj4vUrZq3MD9eLCkv&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/d7df5d47-86d2-4099-bf94-f27bb693d068_2983x1741.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best podcast on cryptocurrency and Web3 is a Chinese one. Surprise! Colin Wu is the founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/WuBlockchain&#34;&gt;Wu Blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. With 510K followers, it is the largest crypto news media that targets both English and Chinese markets. Colin conducts Chinese interviews for crypto KOLs, up and coming founders and accomplished investors, or sometimes hosts a round table panel discussion. If you find something getting hot in crypto, usually Colin will be the first one to invite its founders to speak about it. Especially for all the crypto projects that are founded by Chinese, Colin Wu’s show would be the best place to learn about them. Colin is not the smoothest interviewer in the world and his hosting skill can sometimes be jerky and lack of finesse, but he’s very well respected and people love breaking stories on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-bankless&#34;&gt;5. Bankless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankless.com/podcast&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/9f742702-a01f-435d-9f02-d8e97e559074_2048x779.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by Ryan and David, Bankless is commonly regarded as the No. 1 crypto podcast by many, though I think its glow has faded quite a bit in the last two years. Ryan and David are massive Ethereum fanboys so Bankless serves up everything that’s worth talking about in the world of Ethereum and its sprawling L2s. Vitalik is a frequent guest who sometimes shares his latest philosophical thinking. The show updates very frequently, at least several times a week if not daily. To me its one-hour episode is too long for such a daily show. Unlike Colin Wu, Ryan and David are eloquent speakers but they talk too much - a bit too high on their own supply. Also, Ryan and David don’t come from a technical background. Their apparent lack of technical understanding in many crypto innovations sometimes blindsides them - in 2025 Ethereum is hardly the most innovative or advanced blockchain out there. Its influence has been on a steady decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-unchained&#34;&gt;6. Unchained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unchainedcrypto.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/1556a71d-c4c1-4694-be42-bf65edc71a10_1920x1080.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Shin’s Unchained can barely stay on this list in 2025, but it still has a spot. Laura Shin doesn’t have much technical background or in-depth understanding of crypto, but she’s been in this journalism business covering crypto for a long time and her show can still cover some useful corners that other more edgy podcast shows don’t bother to go. Her show is a useful bridge connecting traditional Wall Street and the government to the crypto world. If you have been away from crypto for a while, just come back and want to rebase yourself in crypto, Shin’s Unchained is a slightly boring but reasonable place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-the-tim-ferriss-show&#34;&gt;7. The Tim Ferriss Show&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tim.blog/podcast/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/464078c6-5350-4ba8-99f6-0cc230dcf07e_1830x1064.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Ferriss’ show would have easily claimed the top spot on this list, when he was far and away the best podcaster in the world, before Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman caught up to this podcast phenomenon. Ferriss doesn’t cover technology exclusively - his show is about breaking down the success formula of successful people, who come from all walks of life. A masterful marketer and promoter, Ferriss himself has an amazing entrepreneurial journey from unlikely trajectories with an illustrious streak of unusual accomplishments, which enables him to hold court with his famous guest speakers. Sometimes he gets carried away by trying too hard in proving I’m-also-good-on-this and it creates slightly cringy moments. That said, Ferriss’ interview on Silicon Yoda master Naval and crypto legend Nick Szabo are must-listen podcast episodes for everyone in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-joe-rogan-experience-jre-podcast&#34;&gt;8. Joe Rogan Experience (JRE Podcast)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joerogan.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/f7c65063-6718-46cd-91fe-e1386aff183b_2500x1667.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogan’s career transformation from a small-time comedian to the most coveted podcaster in the world is quite an impressive feat. His show invites celebrities of all kinds, not just technology. Rogan is a natural dinner host - he makes everyone feel like home by being just another everyday dude sitting right next to you at the bar and sipping beer. Unlike Fridman or Terriss who apparently follow a list of topics to cover and visibly work methodically to check them off, Rogan seems to just follow the flow of the conversation and is very comfortable to go anywhere the guest wants. His recent episodes with Marc Andreessen, Brian Greene (“The Elegant Universe”), and Elon Musk are highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-orange-book-橙皮书&#34;&gt;9. Orange Book (橙皮书)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/%E6%A9%99%E7%9A%AE%E4%B9%A6/id1564192963&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/23a0f9da-a502-4d67-b12a-84f49fb2bf6a_1199x773.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another Chinese podcast that has been able to hold on to high standard, though for smaller audience with more niche topics. Leon Li is a well respected KOL in the Chinese crypto circle. His show doesn’t chase the hottest trends in the industry but talks about interesting subjects and ideas are usually more early-stage before becoming public knowledge. It’s a good complement to other podcasts that cover the basics but don’t go into the frontier enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-future-of-life-institute-podcast&#34;&gt;10. Future of Life Institute Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://futureoflife.org/project/future-of-life-institute-podcast/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/c12ab036-6d66-40f0-b795-806ca70ffd33_2474x1224.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLI (Future of Life) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to “steering transformative technology towards benefiting life and away from extreme large-scale risks”. It hosts many talks with researchers, policy experts, scientists, philosophers and influential thinkers. The conversations are much less commercial (“let me introduce you this great new DeFi protocol”) and much more forward-looking. They are concerned about the arrival of AGI, superintelligence, possible extinction of civilization, autonomous weapons, nuclear wars, quantum computing, etc. It helps to occasionally revisit the doomsday scenario and re-measure how far away we are from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the top 10 tech podcasts I (still) listen to in 2025. Frankly speaking, there is not enough time to consume them so we have to be brutally selective. If you come across another high-quality podcast not on this list, feel free to share that with the community by dropping it in the comment below. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Podcast has become one of my primary sources of information intake, besides Twitter, since more than ten years ago when I lived in Palo Alto, CA. In 2025, podcast is still a very potent channel for information, insight and perspectives of very high density, though its supremacy is being challenged by the rising AI LLMs that can summarize podcast episodes based on transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/podcast.webp&#34; alt=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are getting very long - such as the recent DeepSeek episode on &lt;strong&gt;Lex Fridman&lt;/strong&gt; that clocked at 5 hours 16 minutes, but still, the good ones are worth listening to. These are the top ones from my library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-lex-fridman-podcast&#34;&gt;1. Lex Fridman Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lexfridman.com/podcast&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/1d80e96f-b60d-499f-a44d-ea2ca61e5871_1280x720.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably the best tech-focused podcast right now, surpassing Tim Ferriss. Fridman books the most sought-after guests in the technology industry and has interviewed every superstar scientist and entrepreneur in AI in the last 12 months. Elon Musk is a frequent guest and his chemistry with Fridman produced many famous moments. Fridman is a research scientist at MIT with strong tech background, so he’s able to ask very penetrating questions that get to the core of the topics. Occasionally he gets carried away (like the episode with Neal Stephenson of Snow Crash) by talking too much of himself, but most of the time he is a graceful and skillful host. One complaint: his ad now takes up almost 8-10 minutes upfront in each episode. It’s just audacious but does demonstrate what a strong brand his show has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-acquired&#34;&gt;2. Acquired&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acquired.fm&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/f80c5c6a-a0e4-45af-9714-09859449432d_2054x970.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal do a superb job of researching and dissecting the growth stories of successful companies, from TSMC, NVIDIA, Lockheed Martin, to Duolingo. Their episodes are long - usually 3 hours and above, but extremely insightful, easily trumping any business case write-ups from Stanford/Harvard. Sometimes they interview the founders (Morris Chang of TSMC or Zuckerberg of Meta); sometimes they just walk through the history of a company and break down its less well known success formula (like Lockheed Martin). All their episodes are of very high quality and always intellectually stimulating. It’s a gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-techmeme-ride-home&#34;&gt;3. Techmeme Ride Home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/dcad842f-c071-497c-a5ae-f285b9ea511e_1280x720.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s very hard to do a daily podcast show but Techmeme Ride home pulls it off very well. If you need your daily fix of catching up with what’s going on in either traditional tech or Web3, this is the one and only show for you. Other similar shows are either exclusive on Web3/crypto, or are only covering Web2, which are still important but less exciting. Each episode is only 20 minutes - this is PERFECT. Anything longer than that will just create fatigue and not be able to keep its subscribers engaged on a daily basis. I’m a fan of host Brian McCullough’s rapid-fire style. It’s very energetic, just like a grande hazelnut latte in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-colin-wus-crypto-podcast-吴说不加密播客&#34;&gt;4. Colin Wu’s Crypto Podcast (吴说不加密播客)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/show/0p30Adj4vUrZq3MD9eLCkv&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/d7df5d47-86d2-4099-bf94-f27bb693d068_2983x1741.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best podcast on cryptocurrency and Web3 is a Chinese one. Surprise! Colin Wu is the founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/WuBlockchain&#34;&gt;Wu Blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. With 510K followers, it is the largest crypto news media that targets both English and Chinese markets. Colin conducts Chinese interviews for crypto KOLs, up and coming founders and accomplished investors, or sometimes hosts a round table panel discussion. If you find something getting hot in crypto, usually Colin will be the first one to invite its founders to speak about it. Especially for all the crypto projects that are founded by Chinese, Colin Wu’s show would be the best place to learn about them. Colin is not the smoothest interviewer in the world and his hosting skill can sometimes be jerky and lack of finesse, but he’s very well respected and people love breaking stories on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-bankless&#34;&gt;5. Bankless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankless.com/podcast&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/9f742702-a01f-435d-9f02-d8e97e559074_2048x779.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by Ryan and David, Bankless is commonly regarded as the No. 1 crypto podcast by many, though I think its glow has faded quite a bit in the last two years. Ryan and David are massive Ethereum fanboys so Bankless serves up everything that’s worth talking about in the world of Ethereum and its sprawling L2s. Vitalik is a frequent guest who sometimes shares his latest philosophical thinking. The show updates very frequently, at least several times a week if not daily. To me its one-hour episode is too long for such a daily show. Unlike Colin Wu, Ryan and David are eloquent speakers but they talk too much - a bit too high on their own supply. Also, Ryan and David don’t come from a technical background. Their apparent lack of technical understanding in many crypto innovations sometimes blindsides them - in 2025 Ethereum is hardly the most innovative or advanced blockchain out there. Its influence has been on a steady decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-unchained&#34;&gt;6. Unchained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unchainedcrypto.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/1556a71d-c4c1-4694-be42-bf65edc71a10_1920x1080.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Shin’s Unchained can barely stay on this list in 2025, but it still has a spot. Laura Shin doesn’t have much technical background or in-depth understanding of crypto, but she’s been in this journalism business covering crypto for a long time and her show can still cover some useful corners that other more edgy podcast shows don’t bother to go. Her show is a useful bridge connecting traditional Wall Street and the government to the crypto world. If you have been away from crypto for a while, just come back and want to rebase yourself in crypto, Shin’s Unchained is a slightly boring but reasonable place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-the-tim-ferriss-show&#34;&gt;7. The Tim Ferriss Show&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tim.blog/podcast/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/464078c6-5350-4ba8-99f6-0cc230dcf07e_1830x1064.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Ferriss’ show would have easily claimed the top spot on this list, when he was far and away the best podcaster in the world, before Joe Rogan and Lex Fridman caught up to this podcast phenomenon. Ferriss doesn’t cover technology exclusively - his show is about breaking down the success formula of successful people, who come from all walks of life. A masterful marketer and promoter, Ferriss himself has an amazing entrepreneurial journey from unlikely trajectories with an illustrious streak of unusual accomplishments, which enables him to hold court with his famous guest speakers. Sometimes he gets carried away by trying too hard in proving I’m-also-good-on-this and it creates slightly cringy moments. That said, Ferriss’ interview on Silicon Yoda master Naval and crypto legend Nick Szabo are must-listen podcast episodes for everyone in crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-joe-rogan-experience-jre-podcast&#34;&gt;8. Joe Rogan Experience (JRE Podcast)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joerogan.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/f7c65063-6718-46cd-91fe-e1386aff183b_2500x1667.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogan’s career transformation from a small-time comedian to the most coveted podcaster in the world is quite an impressive feat. His show invites celebrities of all kinds, not just technology. Rogan is a natural dinner host - he makes everyone feel like home by being just another everyday dude sitting right next to you at the bar and sipping beer. Unlike Fridman or Terriss who apparently follow a list of topics to cover and visibly work methodically to check them off, Rogan seems to just follow the flow of the conversation and is very comfortable to go anywhere the guest wants. His recent episodes with Marc Andreessen, Brian Greene (“The Elegant Universe”), and Elon Musk are highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-orange-book-橙皮书&#34;&gt;9. Orange Book (橙皮书)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/%E6%A9%99%E7%9A%AE%E4%B9%A6/id1564192963&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/23a0f9da-a502-4d67-b12a-84f49fb2bf6a_1199x773.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another Chinese podcast that has been able to hold on to high standard, though for smaller audience with more niche topics. Leon Li is a well respected KOL in the Chinese crypto circle. His show doesn’t chase the hottest trends in the industry but talks about interesting subjects and ideas are usually more early-stage before becoming public knowledge. It’s a good complement to other podcasts that cover the basics but don’t go into the frontier enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;10-future-of-life-institute-podcast&#34;&gt;10. Future of Life Institute Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://futureoflife.org/project/future-of-life-institute-podcast/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/10-podcasts-on-tech-in-2025/c12ab036-6d66-40f0-b795-806ca70ffd33_2474x1224.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FLI (Future of Life) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to “steering transformative technology towards benefiting life and away from extreme large-scale risks”. It hosts many talks with researchers, policy experts, scientists, philosophers and influential thinkers. The conversations are much less commercial (“let me introduce you this great new DeFi protocol”) and much more forward-looking. They are concerned about the arrival of AGI, superintelligence, possible extinction of civilization, autonomous weapons, nuclear wars, quantum computing, etc. It helps to occasionally revisit the doomsday scenario and re-measure how far away we are from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the top 10 tech podcasts I (still) listen to in 2025. Frankly speaking, there is not enough time to consume them so we have to be brutally selective.

        <title>Run DeepSeek on MacBook Pro</title>
        <link>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/run-deepseek-on-macbook-pro/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 09:11:53 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/run-deepseek-on-macbook-pro/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released its latest R1 large language model (“LLM”) and took the whole world by surprise. It uses only a tiny fraction of the GPU machine cost of its much bigger rivals like chatGPT from OpenAI, but delivers the same or even better result. It’s open source too, so everyone can use its service for free. The world’s most valuable company NVIDIA lost nearly 17% of its market cap overnight, as R1’s superb performance suggested that piling up NVIDIA’s GPU machines to train LLMs with brute force might not the only way to advance AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/run-deepseek-on-macbook-pro/deepseek.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;deepseek&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I managed to deploy DeepSeek on my MacBook Pro. Here’s how I did it. It’s actually quite simple. The advantage of running an LLM on your home computer is that you can use it without relying on the servers of DeepSeek, which are currently humming full speed ahead and frequently can’t connect due to high traffic. Another benefit is that the questions you throw to DeepSeek - the prompts, will not be sent to the server and potentially be exposed to others. Your prompts reveal a lot about who you are and what you do. It’s best to keep them private on your own local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my MacBook Pro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple M1 Pro, 14-inch, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 GB memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macOS: Sequoia 15.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Disk: 1 TB SSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;a href=&#34;https://iterm2.com&#34;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;, which is a feature-rich replacement for Mac’s default Terminal.app, and install &lt;a href=&#34;https://ollama.com/download/mac&#34;&gt;Ollama&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, Mac’s package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ brew install ollama
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After installation, check the version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ollama --version
ollama version is 0.5.7a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spin up the Ollama server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ollama serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./7ba8553c-9f64-42a7-9c9f-999e61346107_1050x243.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/run-deepseek-on-macbook-pro/7ba8553c-9f64-42a7-9c9f-999e61346107_1050x243.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pick a model that your Mac’s memory and hard disk allow. The bigger the number in front of “B” (for billion of parameters), the more accurate the model is. I’ve downloaded 1.5B, 8B and 14B model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep this Terminal (iTerm2) window open, open another Terminal window and download DeepSeek R1’s 1.5B model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your network is slow, this downloading process may take a few tries, but don’t worry, the download will resume where you left it off. If you have a VPN service that can route your machine through a US IP address, it will speed up the download quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the download/installation is successful, you will see a prompt. Time to fire away your questions! You can now play around with a local copy of DeepSeek, the most advanced AI that resides on your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To restart DeepSeek, just type the same command before, while keeping the Ollama window open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also try out bigger versions of R1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ollama run deepseek-r1:8b

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience DeepSeek’s famous “chain-of-thought (COT)” yourself. It’s quite amusing, though the locally run, distilled model is much slower than what you can get straight out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://chat.deepseek.com&#34;&gt;https://chat.deepseek.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is the price for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run DeepSeek R1’s undistilled model will &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/carrigmat/status/1884244369907278106&#34;&gt;require 768 GB memory and quite a few M4 Mac machines&lt;/a&gt;, which is beyond the reach for most consumers. Running the distilled model is a lot easier and could be done by just anyone. Try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released its latest R1 large language model (“LLM”) and took the whole world by surprise. It uses only a tiny fraction of the GPU machine cost of its much bigger rivals like chatGPT from OpenAI, but delivers the same or even better result. It’s open source too, so everyone can use its service for free. The world’s most valuable company NVIDIA lost nearly 17% of its market cap overnight, as R1’s superb performance suggested that piling up NVIDIA’s GPU machines to train LLMs with brute force might not the only way to advance AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/run-deepseek-on-macbook-pro/deepseek.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;deepseek&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I managed to deploy DeepSeek on my MacBook Pro. Here’s how I did it. It’s actually quite simple. The advantage of running an LLM on your home computer is that you can use it without relying on the servers of DeepSeek, which are currently humming full speed ahead and frequently can’t connect due to high traffic. Another benefit is that the questions you throw to DeepSeek - the prompts, will not be sent to the server and potentially be exposed to others. Your prompts reveal a lot about who you are and what you do. It’s best to keep them private on your own local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my MacBook Pro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple M1 Pro, 14-inch, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 GB memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macOS: Sequoia 15.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Disk: 1 TB SSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up &lt;a href=&#34;https://iterm2.com&#34;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;, which is a feature-rich replacement for Mac’s default Terminal.app, and install &lt;a href=&#34;https://ollama.com/download/mac&#34;&gt;Ollama&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, Mac’s package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ brew install ollama
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After installation, check the version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ollama --version
ollama version is 0.5.7a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spin up the Ollama server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-None&#34; data-lang=&#34;None&#34;&gt;$ ollama serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
