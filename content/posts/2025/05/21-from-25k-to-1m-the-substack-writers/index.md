Apparently, Substack doesn’t want to bring too much attention to [its league tables of top writers](https://substack.com/leaderboard/culture/paid). This link is hidden in an obscure corner. So I took a tour and a snapshot of all the bestselling writers that are topping the 29 categories.

With 20 million active monthly subscribers, Substack has grown into one of the biggest platforms for content creators and writers. Many thought leaders have migrated to Substack from **Twitter** and **Medium**. Since launching my own Substack newsletter three months ago, I’ve seen many copywriters and marketers on Substack teaching people how to write newsletters. This begs the question: which industries have the largest communities on Substack?

If we use the top bestselling writer’s subscribers count as a proxy of the size of the related category, this snapshot suggested that **Technology** and **Business** lead all 29 categories. Their top writers have more than 1 million subscribers.

**Crypto**, as one of the more avant-garde emerging industries, surprisingly is a category of its own. It’s good as it gives Web3 writers more spotlight. It’s bad as Substack doesn’t think crypto is part of **Technology**. It really should be. Technology’s top writer has 10x more subscribers than Crypto’s.
