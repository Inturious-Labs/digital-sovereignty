I started vibe coding early this year. One of the projects I was incubating got stuck in the MVP (minimum viable product) phase. I put on the hat of product manager, opened a **GitHub** kanban board, unleashed 20+ issues related to UI/UX in a flurry fueled by creativity outburst and the founder's anxiety, and labeled them meticulously by issue type with cute colors. 

Then I waited for the frontend developers to fix them and close all these to-do items.

Nothing happened. It was a team of part-timers. Everybody had other priorities. I had to rely on my cofounder to relay the tasks. The developers seemed to have made many changes offline that were not synced to GitHub's code base yet. Documentation was sparse and not up-to-date. The code could not even compile and build successfully. 

**Cursor** was buzzing and eating the lunch for good old **VS Code**. I had not used an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) for more than 10 years since the days of running an engineering team of 10+ developers for my Silicon Valley startup. But what the heck. As a serial startup founder, I am used to taking things into my own hands.

It was an incredible experience. I created from scratch a fully fledged frontend app with **React** framework within three days. It was mobile responsive right from the start - a major challenge for the legacy version. It had all the features I wanted from that quiet kanban board. I could tinker with every button, every paragraph, every screen in real-time on the development server, however I want, whenever I want.

It's not like I didn't know how to do this before. I was knee-deep in **React** development in 2013 when **Facebook** just launched it and challenged the throne of **Google**'s **Angular** on its way to becoming the most popular frontend framework. 

The difference is in the speed of learning. In the old days, I had to study the official documentation religiously and thoroughly for months, whether that's for PostgreSQL, React Native, Gatsby, Pelican, Docusaurus, Svelte, or Internet Computer. I was at the mercy of the technical writers who write those documentation articles. Some are excellent, but some are confusing or even appalling. To learn what is the right way of doing things was very time consuming. I spent many hours seeking answers on **Stack Overflow**. 

With Cursor, I don't have to worry about those at all. With mature tech stacks like React and Python, Cursor is extremely capable and knows way more than I do. For more early-stage nascent stacks like Internet Computer, Cursor knows enough to be dangerous, though I do need to course correct its actions every now and then. 

The flow is easy. I explain what I want in the chat window. Cursor, in its own agentic way, proposes changes to the files, sometimes in a block of a few hundred lines of code. I review the changes and press `Yes` to accept the changes. 

To be honest, I didn't have the technical capability to fully evaluate every single line of code from Cursor. From the comments in the code, I could roughly understand how the logic goes. But after 200 lines of code, I close my eyes and just press `Yes` to accept `ALL`, taking a leap of faith in AI.

So that's how vibe coding works. That's why English is practically the only programming language we have to learn. AI will figure out the nitty-gritty syntax usage of **Haskell** and **C++**. I just need to articulate what I want in plain, conversational language. 

That sounds like blind flying. It is, in some way. But for *frontend* software development, there is a safety net in the end - for the most part, I can easily verify if the feature is implemented successfully by just looking at it and playing with it. 

This new AI-powered workflow changes the dynamics of a development team profoundly. In the past, if a startup wanted to build a presentable MVP for pitching to investors, it would need a project manager to round up everyone, a product manager to develop PRD (Product Requirements Document), a frontend engineer to build a frontend, a UI designer to design the visual assets, a backend developer to build APIs (Application Programming Interface), a test engineer to conduct unit tests, and a head of engineering who is full-stack and can review PRs (pull requests). 

This requires at least 7 members to form an MDU (Minimum Deployment Unit), whether it's for a startup or a new product team in a big tech. If you are lucky enough to have a super 10x developer, you might be able to reduce the team size to 2-3. But 10x developer is very, very rare, and if he does exist in your team, he only wants to spend time on building backend APIs, designing the architecture, or gazing at the cosmos to contemplate mankind's future. Doing frontend work is beneath him and, frankly, a waste of his undeniable talent. 

AI has lowered the development barrier enough that I can now do all these by myself - not for ALL the projects in the world, but for many. No more waiting for my team members. No more dependency on anyone. I almost became a clumsy full-stack engineer myself - not a very seasoned one but enough to bring many ideas to the PoC (Proof-of-Concept) or even MVP stage.

I went on to create another [10+ projects](inturious.com/) with **Claude Code**, by **Anthropic**.

Claude Code is not an IDE but a text-based CLI (Command Line Interface). It seamlessly integrates with the Terminal app on macOS. I can just focus on one screen and make decisions, unlike Cursor, where I have to constantly look at 3 or even 4 screens to make sure AI doesn't over-engineer the task, or go down a path of rabbit hole that I do not approve. I enjoy the zen-like vibe of using Claude Code and listening to the fast and furious typing sound of my mechanical keyboard.

Another major issue with Cursor is that, it tries too hard to please its master and is full of shit.  It routinely applauds, for me and for itself:

- This is an awesome idea!
- This commit will definitely fix the bug!

When it starts saying "should I add some debug messages in the console to help us diagnose the issue?", I know it has exhausted all solutions, has no clue of what to do next, and is trying to transfer the burden to me. Who builds Cursor? It can't be a Chinese team. Chinese usually do the work, keep quiet, and over-deliver. Cursor is anything but that.

Claude, on the other hand, is more measured in its words. It feels like an old captain with steady hands on the wheel. Very quickly, I upgraded to its `$100/month` pro account. 

I had to. This is coding on steroids for someone with no CS (Computer Science) background. Before the arrival of vibe coding in 2025, building something is a journey of zigzagging through the woods, wading through valley creeks, climbing small hills, resting on cliff-edges, going down into another gorge, finding a better path, and scaling a higher peak. 

With AI-powered vibe coding, the journey has become a roller-coaster ride straight to the top. You get what you want, in minutes if not seconds, and you just keep going, with no break.  The only break comes when you run out of your daily/monthly token quota. 

Software development used to come with a bulky baggage and a large part of that ain't pretty. They're essential but boring - like writing commit messages, maintaining a perfect README, and conducting unit tests. Now AI can handle all these, and I get to enjoy only the fun part - let there be light!

I am writing three newsletters now and am going to launch another two soon. I used to host them on **Substack**, but migrated them to a self-hosting stack to allow myself to have total control rather than being hijacked by Substack. 

- Hugo as the frontend
- Canister smart contract on the Internet Computer blockchain as the backend
- Buttondown to handle email sign-ups
- Stripe to handle payments

You can see the entire history on their open-source [GitHub repos](https://github.com/Inturious-Labs).

I would have never mustered enough courage to go on such a Hail Mary journey without Claude Code. Migrating your newsletter/blog site to another platform is a painful and prolonged process. It is not rocket science, but just complex and tedious. 

For a prolific content creator, being able to vibe code is like Tony Stark putting on Iron Man armor for the first time in that cave when he tried to jailbreak from bandits.
