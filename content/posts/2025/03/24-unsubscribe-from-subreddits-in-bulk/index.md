One of my takeaways from listening to the recent [5-hour podcast episode of](https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-marc-andreessens-talk-on) **[Lex Fridman](https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-marc-andreessens-talk-on)** [interviewing](https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-marc-andreessens-talk-on) **[Marc Andreessen](https://digitalsovereignty.herbertyang.xyz/p/recap-of-marc-andreessens-talk-on)** is that **Reddit** matters and has become even more important than ever because all the LLMs crawl its vast public archives of subreddit discussions. Goold old BBS still rocks.

So I quickly returned to my 10-year-old Reddit account and freshened it up with updated links and a profile bio.

I realized I should just unsubscribe from all the current subreddits to start with a clean slate since I’ve moved on to something quite different from a few years ago. Do I have to go into every one of the 50+ communities and click the “leave” button one by one? That seems very time-consuming.

Fortunately, this post from Reddit spared me from that boring work[1](#footnote-1).

Go to this URL,

> <https://old.reddit.com/subreddits>

[![](./7cc0a48a-107e-46ac-979c-11ab2da3e3cc_1261x1286.webp)](./7cc0a48a-107e-46ac-979c-11ab2da3e3cc_1261x1286.webp)

You’ll see that all your subscribed subreddits are listed on the right. Now you can just click the “leave” button one by one, but on the same page, to finish this job in one go.
