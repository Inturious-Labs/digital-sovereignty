## Editor’s Note

I didn’t speak on this panel other than helping the host Anna share a few relevant links. Paul is my colleague in the **[DFINITY Foundation](https://x.com/dfinity)** from the R&D team. DFINITY is the main developer studio behind L1 blockchain ICP. Louis is the founder of **[Omnity Network](https://x.com/OmnityNetwork)**, a leading cross-chain project built on ICP. Both are very experienced technical architects and developers who are widely respected in the crypto community. Anna runs BD for Yuku, a leading metaverse project on ICP.

**Odin.fun**, a memecoin launchpad for BTC Runes has been catching wildfire in the last few days. This AMA is to explain the Chainkey technology that makes Odin.fun fast and secure.

It’s always a pleasure listening to Paul and Louis. I learn a ton every time.
