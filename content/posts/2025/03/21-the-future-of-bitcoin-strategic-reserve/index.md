## Editor’s Note

President Trump's creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve stirred up a wide spectrum of sentiments in the crypto community. Is the dragon slayer going to become just another dragon? Is this Satoshi Nakamoto’s original intent when he wrote the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008? How would US government jump through all kinds of hoops to executive this initiative? What’s the impact on the crypto industry?

Recently there has been an undercurrent of memecoin nihilism brewing in the community. Is memecoin the end game for crypto? Isn’t this just another form of casino? While Bitcoin goes mainstream and becomes legit, what about other altcoins? Many feel that since neither memecoin nor Bitcoin is suitable for building real products, we may have come to the end of the road for crypto and there is no future for real developers who actually want to build things.

I beg to differ. A bear market is the best time for true builders. There are a whole lot of DeFi products that need to be built on Bitcoin L1.
