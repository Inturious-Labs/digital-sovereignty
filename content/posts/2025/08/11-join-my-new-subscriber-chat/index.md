Today I’m announcing a brand new addition to my Substack publication: Digital Sovereignty Chronicle **subscriber chat**.

This is a conversation space exclusively for subscribers—kind of like a group chat or live hangout. I’ll post questions and updates that come my way, and you can jump into the discussion.

## How to get started

1. **Get the Substack app by clicking [this link](https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect) or the button below.** New chat threads won’t be sent via email. You can turn on push notifications to track conversations as they happen. You can also access chat [on the web](https://open.substack.com/pub/digitalsovereignty/chat).

2. **Open the app and tap the Chat icon.** It looks like two bubbles in the bottom bar, and you’ll see a row for my chat inside.
