Managing passwords is never easy. Everybody has to have a protocol that works for them to get through the day-to-day grind, but very few can truly get it right.

The ultimate solution should not be a Moleskin notebook that you carry around or hide in a closet at home. It’s not scalable and very inefficient. Searching is a nightmare.

It should not be an Excel spreadsheet or a text file on your computer. It’s prone to human mistakes. It’s vulnerable to data loss from a corrupted file.

It should not be a commercial password manager such as **1Password** or **LastPass**. They all have a history of being compromised with a leak of sensitive data. They’re also ridiculously expensive.

It should not be the solution from Apple’s iCloud or Google Password Manager. They are too centralized and already know too much about you. It’s too much of a single point of failure, and you don’t want to lock yourself with such a powerful vendor.

It should not be a markdown file vault with git version control synchronized through a home Synology server (my last solution before switching to the current one). It works well for the most part, but it’s not efficient and too much of an acquired taste.

The ultimate solution to manage your passwords while keeping a good balance in **security**, **efficiency**, **cost**, and **convenience** is **Pass** + **GPG** + **Firefox**. The configuration may look intimidating to users with no technical background, but it is entirely manageable if you follow this guide, step by step. It will be a rewarding effort in the long run.

### Preparation

GPG
