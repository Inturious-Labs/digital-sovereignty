<p>Managing passwords is never easy. Everybody has to have a protocol that works for them to get through the day-to-day grind, but very few can truly get it right. </p><p>The ultimate solution should not be a Moleskin notebook that you carry around or hide in a closet at home. It’s not scalable and very inefficient. Searching is a nightmare.</p><p>It should not be an Excel spreadsheet or a text file on your computer. It’s prone to human mistakes. It’s vulnerable to data loss from a corrupted file. </p><p>It should not be a commercial password manager such as <strong>1Password</strong> or <strong>LastPass</strong>. They all have a history of being compromised with a leak of sensitive data. They’re also ridiculously expensive.</p><p>It should not be the solution from Apple’s iCloud or Google Password Manager. They are too centralized and already know too much about you. It’s too much of a single point of failure, and you don’t want to lock yourself with such a powerful vendor.</p><p>It should not be a markdown file vault with git version control synchronized through a home Synology server (my last solution before switching to the current one). It works well for the most part, but it’s not efficient and too much of an acquired taste.</p><p>The ultimate solution to manage your passwords while keeping a good balance in <strong>security</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong>, <strong>cost</strong>, and <strong>convenience</strong> is <strong>Pass</strong> + <strong>GPG</strong> + <strong>Firefox</strong>. The configuration may look intimidating to users with no technical background, but it is entirely manageable if you follow this guide, step by step. It will be a rewarding effort in the long run.</p><h3>Preparation</h3><p>Firefox</p><p>GPG</p><h3>Set up Pass</h3><p></p><h3>Set up Pass-FF for Firefox</h3><p></p><h3>Set up One-Time Passcode (OTP)</h3><p></p><h3>Set up version control with a Git server</h3><p></p><h3>Use Pass on mobile</h3><p></p>
