<h2>Colin Wu Interviews CZ of Binance</h2><p></p><h2>Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner of Dragonfly</h2><h3>The show</h3><ul><li><p>The host of this podcast <em>When Shift Happens</em> talks too much. We’re not interested in you. You’re not Fridman or Rogan. We just want to hear Haseeb talk, ok?</p></li><li><p>The opening exchange of pleasantry is cringy and unnecessary. California is awesome - we get that. Can we move on to the topic?</p></li></ul><h3>Haseeb Qureshi</h3><ul><li><p>I went down the rabbit hole of digging up the background of Qureshi, which he lays out on <a href="https://haseebq.com/about/">his personal website</a>. He’s got an interesting career that went from a world’s top 10 poker player to software engineer to investor. Oh, he still carries the flag of effective altruism, which sounds like, making enough money so that you can give back to the society. Somebody else also said that a while ago.</p></li></ul><h3>Investing</h3><ul><li><p></p></li></ul><div id="youtube2-61B175Ckm2o" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;61B175Ckm2o&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;950s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/61B175Ckm2o?start=950s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
